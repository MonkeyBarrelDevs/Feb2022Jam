## üåé Overview

*Life in space can get lonely, especially when you're a supermassive black hole. It seems like anything you get close to just... disappears! Two brothers, cursed by the nature of their existence, keep each other company in the swirling darkness. Then one day, everything changes, when the two of them come across the cutest, bluest planet in the galaxy: the lovely, lively Earth.*

*But before either of them can seal the deal, danger strikes - a storm of asteroids now threatens to batter their newfound love to death! Can these two brothers guide their planetary darling away from harm, without accidentally consuming her in the process?*
  
Play on your own or with a friend as black holes guiding the Earth away from incoming asteroids, but beware of getting too close! Strike a delicate balance between asteroid-dodging and planet-sucking in a love story for the (space) ages.<br /> <br />
**Starcrossed** was a game created for University of Utah's GameCraft February 2022 GameJam. All assets, audio files, and code was created by Monkey Barrel developers over a 48 hour period, from February 11th to 13th.
